Document Search by Metadata

For documents that can be easily distinguished by metadata, we recommend using metadata to search the documents. This method is ideal for the following document types:

    Financial reports categorized by company and time period
    Legal documents categorized by case type
    Medical records categorized by patient or condition
    And many others

In such cases, you can search documents by leveraging their metadata. A popular method is to use “Query to SQL” for document retrieval.
Example Pipeline
PageIndex Tree Generation

Upload all documents into PageIndex to get their doc_id.
Set up SQL tables

Store documents along with their metadata and the PageIndex doc_id in a database table.
Query to SQL

Use an LLM to transform a user’s retrieval request into a SQL query to fetch relevant documents.
Retrieve with PageIndex

Use the PageIndex doc_id of the retrieved documents to perform further retrieval via the PageIndex retrieval API.
